Commands
--------
These can be found in [the commands List](https://goo.gl/vuo1cB).

 
### Bot DJ
 
Bots can now join the wait list and dj along with you. See the noted commands in the commands section.
Anyone with a role of Bouncer or higher can run the bot's dj commands.
 
Expected usage:
1. Ensure the account running the bot has at least one playlist and a playlist set to active and start the bot as usual.
2. Others can then type !listjoin, !jumpup, or !dj into the room chat to have your bot join the waitlist.
3. When done, type !listleave, !jumpdown, or !dj to have your bot leave the waitlist.
 
Grab - Adding to the bot playlist:
Run the !grab command to tell the bot to grab the current song. The song will be added to the bot's current active playlist.
 
Users can also use !showplaylists or !botpls to list the bot's available playlists and !switchplaylist or !botpl to switch the bot's current playlist.
